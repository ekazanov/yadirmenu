* Yadirmenu

** What the "Yadirmenu" name means:

"Yadirmenu" stands for "Yet Another Dirmenu."

** Why:

The goal of creating Yadirmenu was to provide a simple menu interface
that can be run on different platforms as a frontend for user scripts
and/or documents.

Currently, Yadirmenu can be used on the following platforms:

- Linux
- Termux (Terminal for Android)
- Possibly Windows (although it has not been tested)

** What:

Yadirmenu is designed to create a menu for a set of user scripts and
documents. Given a directory tree, Yadirmenu generates a menu where
directories are represented as submenus and scripts are represented as
menu items.

With this menu, users can:

- Navigate through menus and submenus.
- Execute scripts represented as menu items.
- Exit the menu.
