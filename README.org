* What is Yadurmenu
The main goal of an Yadirmenu is to create a simple menu interface for
the set of user's scripts and documents. Given a directory tree the
Yadirmenu creates a menu. In this menu directories are represented as
submenus and scripts are represented as the menu items.

Given this menu one can:
- Navigate through menu/submenus.
- Start scripts.
- Exit menu.
